Problem 1 (10 points):
Score += 10

Problem 2 (10 points):
Your lines should be smoother. The way to fix this is to add more slices in your np.linspace. I believe this problem says to use 200 slices. Let me know if that doesn't make sense or if you need help!
Score += 7

Problem 3 (5 points):
Score += 5

Problem 4 (5 points):
lowest_rank_approx() failed with error = 7.138335392334647 (showing ||A - Ahat||_2)
	Correct response: 6.261345244394619

lowest_rank_approx() failed with error = 7.750160673957143 (showing ||A - Ahat||_2)
	Correct response: 6.691019072576811
	Student response: 7.850160673957142
Score += 1

Problem 5 (15 points):
Great that you plotted the original image and the approximation, but the approximation should be stored with 1113078 fewer entries than the original
Again, your entries are not as they should be
Entries should say 3425034
